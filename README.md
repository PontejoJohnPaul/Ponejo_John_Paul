My code is a simple code, first i make a main class, them i make four methods name guess_the_word, guess_the_number, guess_the_map, and lastly the main_choice. The guess_the_word method and guess_the_map is like the same but different
categories for the guess_the_word its like you guessing the Proggraming Language and for the guess_the_map it is like
guessing the Citys in other countries. Like London, Paris and more. In my geuss_the_number it is different this is
guessing the random number and it has a level 1-3. Also in my guess_the_word and map it has a clue for it to not to be
difficult to others to play and its giving a random words and random number also.
